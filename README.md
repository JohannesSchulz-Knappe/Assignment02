### Title: What does explain the recent electoral success of the AfD in the different state constituencies of Germany? 

### Description of the project

This repository is created for the second pair assignment of the course [MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures), taught by [Christopher Gandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud). This readme file clearly elucidates our work done for this assignment.

The task for this assignment is to present a proposal for our Collaborative Research Project. Here, we layout our research paper question, establish its relevance, provide an overview of relevant literatures using BibTeX, and identify data sources and methodologies that we will use to examine the central question of our paper.

### Documents in the repository

Besides this readme, there are two files in the repository

- [Assignment02.Rmd](https://github.com/JohannesSchulz-Knappe/Assignment02/blob/master/Assignment02.Rmd) which contains main research proposal
- [Library.bib](https://github.com/JohannesSchulz-Knappe/Assignment02/blob/master/Library.bib) which contains the relevant references for our study. 

### Project progress

During the work on this project, we faced mainly two obstacles: 1) The restricted availability of one of us to contribute to the project due to extended illness, and 2) the difficulty of finding an adequate research question. After trying to access several electoral datasets on European level, we decided to narrow the scope of our research project down in order to keep data cleaning work at a reasonable level and to deal with a more pronounced research question. The substantial electoral success of a very young party in the German states in March 2016 finally inspired us to the research question presented in the proposal.
