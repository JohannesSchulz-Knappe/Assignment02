### Description of the project

This repository was created for the second pair assignment of the course [MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures), taught by [Christopher Gandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud). This readme file documents our work done for this assignment.

The task for this assignment is to present a proposal for our Collaborative Research Project. Here, we layout our research paper question, establish its relevance, provide an overview of existing literature using BibTeX, and identify data sources and methodologies that we will access to answer the question.
