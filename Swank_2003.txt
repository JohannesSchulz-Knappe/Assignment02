Emprical models and measurements


focus on RRWP vote shares in national parliamentary elections in 16 West
European nations between 1981 and 1998.

--> This analysis is quite old. Do similar findings hold for the AfD success
in the German state elections in 2016?

central propositions about internationalization and its mediation by welfare
state structures:
	Several factors highlighted in the theoretical, case study and
	quantiative literatures on the rise of the new far right

--> AfD as a possible "late comer" in the European arena? Do similar factors 
apply, or did the Eurocrisis and Refugee Crisis pose new challenges.



general model of RRWP vote shares:
Electoral success will be directly influenced by a set of domestic economic and
political forces
- Post-industrialization: focus on highly-skilled workforce in economy
	potential loss of social status for those in traditional occupation
- economic growth and unemployment rates highlighted in some of the quantitative 
  analyses --> control for macro-economic performance (sources)
p. 227
- control for the effects of proportional representation (PR)
- "new left party success will be related to subsequent rises in RRWP party
  vote shares"
- Kitschelt (1995): Established right -> embracing centrist policies -> allow
  RRWP parties to capture terrain of neoliberal reform
	Where established right weak/in decline --> more success of RRWP
p. 228

RRWP = lag (not possible), Tradeopenness (hmm), CapMob (?), Foreign (?),
Welstate (!), manufact, growth, prorep, leftlib, right, taxation, error

- Lag to correct serially correlated errors
- Trade-openness (not possible), capital mobility (not possible)
- Foreign: Inflows of asylum seekers and refugees (proportion to population x1000)
-> effects of European economic integration
- Welfare state intensity
- percentage of wage and salary workers in manufakturing (lagged)
- economic growth (lagged) (post 1973 deterioration of macro economic
  performance argument), 
p.229
  unemployment
- prorep - character of the electoral system 
--> are there differences in state vote in the three contexts?
- leftlib voteshare in previous election (?)
- electoral strength of right, elections of previous years
- tax backlash literature, --> data on taxation?


Estimation

--> 
OLS estimation of a linear model ? Mujahed might know more.
Controlling for the specific state?


p. 230 
Findings!
- Volume of refugees and asylum seekers systematically and positively
- international immigration relatively large 
--> rate of foreigners as positive or negative impact?
- direct effect of the welfare state (like labor market programmes --> less RRWP)
- manufacturing not as strong
- slow economic growth not related
- left libertarian and tax burdens signficant
- electoral success of established right parties in rec. el. not significant in
  baseline model
- past RRWP highly significant

p. 238
Conclusions
Globalization significant domestic political effects -> more RRWP
