# Introduction

This research proposal is the second assignment for the course [MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures), taught by [Christopher Gandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud) at the Hertie School of Governance in spring term 2016. In this proposal, we select our research topic, provide information on its relevance, present current literature, and identify the datasets and methodology that we are going to base our work on.


# The Research Project

On March 13, 2016, Germany's political landscape experienced "a landslide"[@Zeit2016]. At the three state elections in Bade-Württemberg, Rhinland-Palatinate, and Saxony-Anhalt, the young party "Alternative für Deutschland" (Alternative for Germany) received double digit results from scratch, not being present in the state parliaments before. In Baden-Württemberg (BW), the party received 15.1%, in Rhineland-Palatinate (RP) 12.6%, and in Saxony-Anhalt (SA) even 24.3%.(Wikipedia 202-205), becoming the third strongest party in BW and RP, and the second strongest in SA.
Not only does the tremendous success of this new policital player harden the set up of the future governments in the respective states [@Spiegel2016], it is also a clear sign that the party has arrived in mainstream politics in Germany.

In this research project ...


Having been founded in February 2013 initially as a eurosceptic party, the AfD just missed the entry into the German national parliament at the federal elections in September 2013 by only 125,000 votes [@SchmittBeck2015]. Not a single party in the post-war era was that successful in national elections being only established seven months before[@Niedermayer2014]. 
This emergence is attributed to the Eurocrisis and chancelor Merkels strong state interventionist austerity politcs that opened political potential to the right of the established right parties CDU/CSU and FDP. The AfD recognized that potential and positioned itself initially as an expert knowledge based eurosceptic party. But over the last years, it became a new host for now unrepresented national conservatives as well as right wing populists. The unifying factors for these different groups are the anti-establishment attitude of the AfD, the image of being the political underdog that is "honest" in face of political and medial lies. In this regard, the AfD shares similarities to other European right wing populist parties [@Hausler2015].


As long as the refugee crisis persists, it is assumed that the AfD is going to continue to gain more support [@Spiegel2016].

Implications for other parties - For example, within the CDU, the leading conservative party in Germany, a large debate arose whether the refugee crisis response by chancellor Angela Merkal was responsible for the loss in votes. Interestingly, leaders of other parties who supported Merkels "Wir schaffen das" experienced less loss of votes. However, left parties such as "Die Linke" seemed to be especially vulnerable to the emergence of the AfD.[@Spiegel2016] Also, the social democrats (SPD) seem to have lost many voters to the AfD [@Zeit2016]

Early electoral analysis has shown that the AfD was especially successful in mobilizing former non-voters [@Spiegel2016] (better source needed). It was also very successful amongst labourers and unemployed people. In SA, almost on third of this group voted for the AfD. But the analysis also showed that more people with medium education and middle class income voted for the AfD. It is suggested that they are increasingly afraid of change, see the refugee crisis as a culmination of threat, and are sceptical in the governments capacity to solve it.[@Zeit2016]





While electorary analysis already showed from which social groups AfD voter are [^KEY1], we want to use the macro-data on constituency level to understand, how these paterns translate to the reality.


We will use the data provided by the

Second, several descriptive statistics (such as maps, plots and histograms) can be calculated and presented on a webpage.

Data collection, analysis and presentation is implemented in R [@CiteR].

# Literature review

In a mixed-methods study focussing on the AfD's history, self-description, positioning in the public discourse, and its supporters, @Berbuir2015 found that the party can be described as a "functional equivalent for a right-wing populist party in a country where right-wing politics are strongly stigmatised." [@Berbuir2015] For our research this means that the AfD can be located in the tradtion of new radical right wing populist (RRWP) parties in western Europe.

When it comes to understand the rise of RRWP parties, @Ivarsflaten2008 and @Swank2004 offer important insights.
In their large scale study comparing the electoral success of RRWP parties, @Ivarsflaten2008 found that successful RRWP parties almost always used anti-immigration rhethorics in their electoral campaigns. The other two focus areas of RRWP parties - opposing political elitism and complains about the economic development - were not always important for electoral success and seem to be more context specific.
@Swank2004 analyzed the impact of globalization on the electoral success of RRWP in national elections in 16 Western European nations between 1981 and 1998. Their core finding was that the generousity of the welfare state was an important factor that mitigated the impact of economic globalizations in the rise of RRWP parties. Besides that, they found that the volume of refugees and asylum seekers, international immigration, the heighth of the domestic tax burden, previous electoral success of left libertarian parties, and the past voteshare of the RRWP party all systematically and positively influenced their the electoral success. The rate of

In addition, we will control for East and West German electoral districts and classical political participation, measures in voter turnout.

# Hypotheses

Whith the findings of the studies on RRWP parties in western Europe in mind, we want to understand...


Economic factor hypotheses

H1: 

Immigration related hypotheses


Social factor hypotheses

Check this out: $s^2 =
\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.

# Data sources

Citation:
In order to relate this variable with aggregate data on the district, we will merge the existing data frame with a data set of the Federal Returning Officer [@Bwldata, csv. format] (probably using the `dplyr` package), which contains information on the level of education, unemployment rate & business tax (as proxies of economic situation), housing space and population density. 

The data on gender and age distribution as well as the number of refugees will be gathered from the Federal Statistical Office DESTATIS [@DESTATIS, csv. format]. However, the data here is not available on the electoral district level but only on the county level. These two administrative districts match very often, but not always. Therefore we will follow the approach used by the Federal Returning Officer and disaggregate the data according to population size in the districts.

# Methodology

OLS estimation of a linear model ? Mujahed might know more.

The descriptive statistics serve to understand and describe the data. Besides measures of variance and distribution, colored maps that illustrate the situation in each electoral district will be provided.
