## Introduction

This research proposal is the second assignment for the course [MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures), taught by [Christopher Gandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud) at the Hertie School of Governance in spring term 2016. In this proposal, we select our research topic, provide information on its relevance, present current literature, and identify the datasets and methodology that we are going to base our work on.


## Research Topic

In the last German state elections in March 2016 in Bade-Württemberg, Rhinland-Palatinate, and Saxony-Anhalt, the radical right wing populist (RRWP) party Alternative for Germany [AfD] received surprising vote share...

While electorary analysis already showed from which social groups AfD voter are [^KEY1]

### Research Question

What explaines the electoral success of the AfD in German state elections?


Economic factor hypotheses

H1: 

Immigration related hypotheses


Social factor hypotheses

Check this out: $s^2 =
\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.
