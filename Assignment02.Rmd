# Introduction

This research proposal is the second assignment for the course [MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures), taught by [Christopher Gandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud) at the Hertie School of Governance in spring term 2016. In this proposal, we select our research topic, provide information on its relevance, present current literature, and identify the datasets and methodology that we are going to base our work on.


# Research Project

On March 13, 2016, Germany's political landscape experienced "a landslide". At the three state elections in Bade-Württemberg, Rhinland-Palatinate, and Saxony-Anhalt, the party "Alternative für Deutschland" (Alternative for Germany) received double digit results from scratch, not being present in the state parliaments before. In Baden-Württemberg (BW), the party received 15.1%, in Rhineland-Palatinate (RP) 12.6%, and in Saxony-Anhalt (SA) even 24.3%.(Wikipedia 202-205), becoming the third strongest party in BW and RP, and the second strongest in SA.
Not only does the tremendous success of this new policital player harden the set up of the future governments in the respective states [@Spiegel2016], it is also a clear sign that the party has arrived in mainstream politics in Germany.

In this research project, we want to understand the environment in which the AfD could be that successful. We will analyze the party's success on a constituency level

Early electoral analysis also has shown that the AfD was especially successful in mobilizing former non-voters [@Spiegel2016] (better source needed).

As long as the refugee crisis persists, it is assumed that the AfD is going to continue to gain more support [@Spiegel2016].

Implications for other parties - For example, within the CDU, the leading conservative party in Germany, a large debate arose whether the refugee crisis response by chancellor Angela Merkal was responsible for the loss in votes. Interestingly, leaders of other parties who supported Merkels "Wir schaffen das" experienced less loss of votes. However, left parties such as "Die Linke" seemed to be especially vulnerable to the emergence of the AfD.[@Spiegel2016]


During the federal elections in September 2013, the AfD just missed the entry into the German national parliament by only 125,000 votes [@SchmittBeck2015]. According to @Niedermayer2014, not a single party in the post-war era was that successful in national elections being only established seven months before.


While electorary analysis already showed from which social groups AfD voter are [^KEY1], we want to use the macro-data on constituency level to understand, how these paterns translate to the reality.


We will use the data provided by the

First, by relating it to other data on the electoral district, retrieved from the federal statistical office [@DESTATIS] and the Federal Returning Officer ['Bundeswahlleiter', @Bwldata], the influence of certain determinants (socio-demographic and economic factors, i.a.) 
...
Second, several descriptive statistics (such as maps, plots and histograms) can be calculated and presented on a webpage.

Data collection, analysis and presentation is implemented in R [@CiteR].

# Literature review

In a mixed-methods study focussing on the AfD's history, self-description, positioning in the public discourse, and its supporters, @Berbuir2015 found that the party can be described as a "functional equivalent for a right-wing populist party in a country where right-wing politics are strongly stigmatised." [@Berbuir2015] For our research this means that the AfD can be located in the tradtion of new radical right wing populist (RRWP) parties in western Europe.

When it comes to understand the rise of RRWP parties, @Ivarsflaten2008 and @Sweng2004 offer important insights.
In their large scale study comparing the electoral success of RRWP parties, @Ivarsflaten2008 found that successful RRWP parties almost always used anti-immigration rhethorics in their electoral campaigns. The other two focus areas of RRWP parties - opposing political elitism and complains about the economic development - were not always important for electoral success and seem to be more context specific.
@Sweng2004 analyzed the impact of globalization on the electoral success of RRWP in western Europe.

In addition, we will control for East and West German electoral districts and classical political participation, measures in voter turnout.

# Hypotheses

What explaines the electoral success of the AfD in German state elections?


Economic factor hypotheses

H1: 

Immigration related hypotheses


Social factor hypotheses

Check this out: $s^2 =
\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.

# Data sources

Citation:
In order to relate this variable with aggregate data on the district, we will merge the existing data frame with a data set of the Federal Returning Officer [@Bwldata, csv. format] (probably using the `dplyr` package), which contains information on the level of education, unemployment rate & business tax (as proxies of economic situation), housing space and population density. 

The data on gender and age distribution as well as the number of refugees will be gathered from the Federal Statistical Office DESTATIS [@DESTATIS, csv. format]. However, the data here is not available on the electoral district level but only on the county level. These two administrative districts match very often, but not always. Therefore we will follow the approach used by the Federal Returning Officer and disaggregate the data according to population size in the districts.

# Methodology

Citation:
The descriptive statistics serve to understand and describe the data. Besides measures of variance and distribution, colored maps that illustrate the situation in each electoral district will be provided.
